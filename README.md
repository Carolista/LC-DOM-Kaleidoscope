# LC-DOM-Kaleidoscope

To get my OWN practice with the DOM - I created an interactive page for users to create beautiful kaleidoscope imagery! 

Demo: https://carolista.github.io/LC-DOM-Kaleidoscope/

UPDATES:

This project listed as inspiration for students alongside dozens of examples, practice exercises, and graded assignment prep projects at https://carolista.github.io/student-resources/
