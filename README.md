# LC-DOM-Kaleidoscope

More practice with the DOM - Create an interactive page for users to create beautiful kaleidoscope imagery! Don't worry about the layout, style, or algorithms - the starter code has all that taken care of so you can just focus on using the DOM to make it interactive for users.

Students - FORK this to your own account and then clone down to your local machine.

This is part of a larger group of practice exercises and examples for students of LaunchCode's Web Development course (unit 1). See this document for the full list of repls, respositories, etc. https://tinyurl.com/y3bn6st4
